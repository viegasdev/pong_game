Hello! Thanks for downloading my Pong version! :)
I really hope that you like it!

CONTROLS:
Paddle A (left) -> W to move up and S to move down
Paddle B (right) -> Arrow Up to move up and Arrow Down to move down

Attention: Once you open the python file, it will ask you (in terminal) to insert Player's A name and Player's B name and then, the game will immediately!

Thanks for playing!
